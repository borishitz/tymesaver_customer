                            Noah’s Ark acknowledges that a valid prescription from a licensed physician must be presented to Kurve Therapeutics for the device to be distributed to the patient.
                            The Said prescription will be provided for each order placed by the Noah’s Ark prior to manufacture and distribution. No device may be redistributed to another patient without
                            adherence to the medical prescription requirements, regardless of the means of procurement of the device. This will include device returns to Noah’s Ark, who will agree to send
                            all returned devices to Kurve Therapeutics for baseline testing and resale.
